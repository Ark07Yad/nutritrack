 * The browser then reports "Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the
 * server responded with a MIME type of text/html", which says nothing about the
 * actual problem — the file is simply not there. That happens for real during a
 * deploy, when a client holding the previous index.html requests a bundle that
 * has just been replaced.
 *
 * So: real 404s for assets, app shell for client routes.
